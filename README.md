# WebWorld

WebWorld is an Android app that allows you to play in 3D worlds written in JavaScript.  
Learn some JavaScript and you can build your own games or other 3D worlds and share them for others to play.

See the [https://gallantrealm.com/webworld](https://gallantrealm.com/webworld) for more information
on creating games and other worlds for WebWorld.

This version of the WebWorld project is now ported to Android Studio.  The MyWorld, MyScript and MyAndroid project's code
are now part of the WebWorld project.  (I haven't yet figured out how to cleanly separate these and
still have Android Studio build them.)
