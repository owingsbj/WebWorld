# WebWorld

WebWorld is an Android app that allows you to play in 3D worlds written in JavaScript.  Learn some JavaScript and you can build your own games or other 3D worlds and share them for others to play.

See the [https://webworld.gallantrealm.com](https://webworld.gallantrealm.com) for more information on creating games and other worlds for WebWorld.

This WebWorld project depends on the MyWorld, MyScript and MyAndroid projects.  The MyWorld and MyScript projects are currently in private Github repositories.  (Still cleaning them up in order to make them public.)
