	<p>Welcome to Egg World!
	<h3>Choose and Decorate an Egg</h3>
	<p>
		To choose an egg, touch the <i>Choose your Egg</i> button. There are two dozen eggs to choose from. A dozen of them are already decorated, and a dozen are for
		you to decorate. To decorate an egg, select oneof the eggs named "Custom" and press <i>Decorate</i>.
	<h3>Choose a World</h3>
	<p>
		There are 12 different worlds in Egg World. To select a world, press <i>Choose World</i> and move through the worlds to choose.  Some worlds
		are games, with scoring or levels.  Other worlds are just for building, exploring and playing.
	<h3>Playing</h3>
	<p>
		To start playing with the chosen egg and world, press <i>Play</i>. You will need to wait a bit until the 3D initializes.
	<h3>Changing View</h3>
	<p>
		You can change the view of a game by repeatedly touching the <i>View</i> button. Four different views are available.
	<h3>Pause/Resume</h3>
	<p>
		Touch the <i>Pause</i> button to pause the game. When paused, you can use your fingers to zoom and rotate your view. On recent Android versions, you can use
		this to adjust your perspective and "snap" a picture of the action!
	<h3>Moving</h3>
	<p>There are three ways to move your egg:
	<ol>
		<li>Tilt - to turn the egg, tilt left and right. To move forward and backward, tilt front and back.
		<li>Touch - use the large egg button on the bottom left or right. Touch and drag on it up, down, left and right to move and turn.
		<li>Controller - Egg World supports most game controllers.  You can also use the keyboard on a Chromebook.  See gallantrealm.com for help on using controllers.
	</ol>
	<h3>Levels</h3>
	<p>
		Most game worlds have levels to move up in where the game gets harder. To reset the level, use the <i>Reset Score</i> button on the Choose World page.
	<p>
	<p>Enjoy!
