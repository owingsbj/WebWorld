# myAndroid

A library of widgets and tools I use in building android apps.

The classes in this library fall into three groups:

- widgets: these are controls that can be used within layouts of the user interface
- dialogs: some common dialogs for performing certain tasks
- abstract classes: these are classes providing common behaviors and are meant to be subclassed.

In addition, there are theming and translation classes.
