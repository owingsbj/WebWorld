/**
 * An action is a client capability that can be performed for a user or upon an object in the world. Actions differ from
 * behaviors in that actions are performed on the client while behaviors are performed on the server. Actions will
 * typically be shown in a menu or toolbar. When in a toolbar, they can start/stop depending on when the user is
 * pressing or clicking on the action.
 * <p>
 * By being part of the model, it is possible to create actions that are platform independent. However, some actions are
 * likely to be platform dependent (displaying dialogs or performing platform specific functions).
