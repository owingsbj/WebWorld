/**
 * This class is subclassed to create behaviors that can be added to world objects. The methods ending in "Event" on
 * this class are invoked for certain events that influence the object. The default implementation of these methods does
 * nothing, but the method can be overridden to provide logic to take action upon the event, such as changing properties
 * of the object or its surroundings.
 * <p>
 * Behavior classes are limited in their capabilities. Firstly, they are only a single class, although it is possible to
 * share logic by subclassing behaviors. Secondly, it is protected from impacting the state of any entity other than the
 * one in which the behavior is associated, although it is possible for behaviors to "message" to each other.
