 * Creates a primitive with a complex surface shape composed from a two dimensional array of rectangles. Three types of
 * meshes are possible: flat, cylindrical, and spherical. A flat mesh can be used for land and other large flat
 * surfaces. Cylindrical is useful for "carved" objects such as statues and limbs of an avatar. Spherical meshes can
 * simulate round objects like the head of an avatar or a model of a planet.
